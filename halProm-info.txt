Hello all.. I was ill for some weeks my left Index finger was broken and beside that I have Job and Family so there was Not enough time for an Update.. sorry..

I Have Made some Progress with new examples, gui, openGl , macros, dim variable and suffixes, much more.. I add new examples at my other Board.. more to come later..

And send an updated Version of HalProment Basic (22. August 2024). Tested all examples again. Hope they are working all fine, thanks Frank
